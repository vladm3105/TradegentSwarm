key_finding: Hyperscaler AI infrastructure spending accelerating into 2026

thesis: Data center semiconductor demand will exceed consensus estimates through H1 2026

data_points:
  - source: Microsoft Q3 earnings call
    quote: "AI infrastructure spend increasing 50% QoQ"
    implication: Sustained demand for NVDA, AMD data center GPUs
  - source: Meta infrastructure announcement
    quote: "$40B committed to AI infrastructure buildout"
    implication: Multi-year demand visibility for GPU suppliers
  - source: Amazon AWS re:Invent preview
    quote: "Custom AI chip capacity doubling by mid-2026"
    implication: Both custom silicon and GPU demand growing in parallel

risks:
  - risk: Export controls expansion
    probability: medium
    mitigation: Diversification to non-China markets accelerating
  - risk: AI spending pullback if ROI disappoints
    probability: low
    mitigation: Early productivity gains supporting continued investment

implications:
  - implication: NVDA likely to exceed FY2026 guidance
    confidence: high
    tickers:
      - NVDA
      - AMD
  - implication: Server DRAM/NAND demand stronger than expected
    confidence: medium
    tickers:
      - MU
      - WDC
