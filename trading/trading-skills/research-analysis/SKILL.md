## Research Framework

### Step 1: Define the Question

```
RESEARCH QUESTION:
What are you trying to understand or prove?

Examples:
- "Will AI infrastructure spending continue through 2025?"
- "How will rate cuts affect regional banks?"
- "Is the semiconductor cycle turning?"

Make it specific and answerable.
```

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

```
PRIMARY SOURCES (preferred):
□ Company earnings calls and presentations
□ SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
□ Federal Reserve statements and data
□ Government statistics (BLS, Census)
□ Industry association reports

SECONDARY SOURCES:
□ Analyst research
□ News articles
□ Expert commentary
□ Academic papers

FOR EACH SOURCE:
- Document what it says
- Assess reliability
- Note date (recency matters)
```

### Step 3: Develop Thesis

```
THESIS STATEMENT:
One clear sentence stating your conclusion.

SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS:
1. [Argument with evidence]
2. [Argument with evidence]
3. [Argument with evidence]

COUNTER-ARGUMENTS:
1. [What could disprove this]
2. [Alternative interpretation]

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: High / Medium / Low
```

### Step 4: Define Implications

```
TRADING IMPLICATIONS:

Beneficiaries (long candidates):
- Ticker: Reason
- Ticker: Reason

Losers (short/avoid candidates):

Sector positioning:
- Overweight: Sectors
- Underweight: Sectors

Timing considerations:
- When thesis plays out

```

### Step 5: Set Review Schedule

```
VALIDITY PERIOD:
How long is this research valid?
- Short-term (30 days)
- Medium-term (90 days)
- Long-term (1 year)

REVIEW TRIGGERS:
What events would require reassessment?
- Specific data releases
- Earnings from key companies
- Policy changes

FALSIFICATION CRITERIA:
What would prove this thesis wrong?
