## Research Framework (7 Steps)

```
Step 1: Define the Question      → What are you trying to understand?
Step 2: Gather Evidence          → Primary and secondary sources
Step 3: Develop Thesis           → Clear statement with arguments
Step 4: Steel-Man Counter-Thesis → Argue the opposite view
Step 5: Bias Check               → Self-assessment
Step 6: Define Implications      → Trading actions
Step 7: Set Review Schedule      → Validity and triggers
```

## Step 1: Define the Question

```
RESEARCH QUESTION:
What are you trying to understand or prove?

Examples:
- "Will AI infrastructure spending continue through 2025?"
- "How will rate cuts affect regional banks?"
- "Is the semiconductor cycle turning?"
- "What is the impact of tariffs on automotive supply chains?"

CRITERIA FOR GOOD QUESTIONS:
□ Specific (not vague)
□ Answerable with data
□ Actionable (leads to trades)
□ Timely (relevant now)

Make it specific and answerable.
```

---

## Step 2: Gather Evidence

```
PRIMARY SOURCES (preferred):
□ Company earnings calls and presentations
□ SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
□ Federal Reserve statements and data
□ Government statistics (BLS, Census)
□ Industry association reports
□ Patent filings

SECONDARY SOURCES:
□ Analyst research
□ News articles
□ Expert commentary
□ Academic papers

FOR EACH SOURCE:
| Source | Date | Key Finding | Reliability |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| | | | High/Medium/Low |

RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT:
- High: Primary data, official sources, recent
- Medium: Reputable secondary, analyst research
- Low: Opinion pieces, old data, unverified

NOTE: Prefer recent sources. Old data may be stale.
```

---

## Step 3: Develop Thesis

```
THESIS STATEMENT:
One clear sentence stating your conclusion.

SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS:
For each argument:
| # | Argument | Evidence | Source | Weight |
|---|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | | | | 0.0-1.0 |
| 2 | | | | 0.0-1.0 |
| 3 | | | | 0.0-1.0 |

Weights should reflect importance to thesis.

COUNTER-ARGUMENTS (brief):
1. [What could disprove this]
2. [Alternative interpretation]

REASONING:
Write 2-3 paragraphs explaining the thesis:
- Why is this the right conclusion?
- What connects the evidence?
- Why is this actionable now?

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: High / Medium / Low
CONFIDENCE %: ___
```

---

## Step 4: Steel-Man Counter-Thesis (NEW v2.1)

```
*** CRITICAL: This prevents confirmation bias ***

COUNTER-THESIS STATEMENT:
Write the OPPOSITE thesis as if you believed it.

COUNTER-THESIS ARGUMENTS:
| # | Argument | Evidence |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |

COUNTER-THESIS STRENGTH: 1-10

WHY YOUR THESIS STILL WINS:
Despite the counter-thesis, explain why your view is better:
- What does counter-thesis miss?
- Why is your evidence stronger?
- What asymmetry favors your view?

CONDITIONS WHERE COUNTER-THESIS WOULD BE RIGHT:
What would have to happen for the opposite view to win?
- Specific data points
- Events
- Timeframes

This section forces intellectual honesty.
```

---

## Step 5: Bias Check (NEW v2.1)

```
MANDATORY BIAS ASSESSMENT:

CONFIRMATION BIAS:
□ Did I search for evidence AGAINST my thesis? Y/N
□ What contrary sources did I check?
□ Did I give contrary evidence fair weight?

RECENCY BIAS:
□ Am I overweighting recent data? Y/N
□ Did I check long-term historical patterns?
□ Is recent data representative or anomalous?

OVERCONFIDENCE:
□ Is my confidence level justified? Y/N
□ What would a skeptic say?
□ Confidence calibration: "I've been right ___% on similar calls"

ANCHORING:
□ Am I anchored to a prior view? Y/N
□ What anchor value might be influencing me?
□ Would I reach same conclusion starting fresh?

BOTH SIDES CONSIDERED:
□ Have I given the counter-thesis fair treatment? Y/N
□ Would I feel comfortable arguing the other side?

BIAS SUMMARY:
Write summary of bias assessment and any corrections made.
```

## Step 6: Define Implications

```
TRADING IMPLICATIONS:

BENEFICIARIES (long candidates):
| Ticker | Reason | Conviction |
|--------|--------|------------|
| | | High/Medium/Low |
| | | High/Medium/Low |

LOSERS (short/avoid candidates):
| Ticker | Reason | Conviction |
|--------|--------|------------|
| | | High/Medium/Low |

SECTOR POSITIONING:
Overweight:
- Sector 1
- Sector 2

Underweight:
- Sector 1
- Sector 2

TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
- When thesis plays out: ___
- Key catalysts to watch:
  - Catalyst 1: Date
  - Catalyst 2: Date

IMPLICATIONS REASONING:
Write paragraph explaining why these implications follow from thesis.
```

## Step 7: Set Review Schedule

```
VALIDITY PERIOD:
How long is this research valid?
- Short-term (30 days)
- Medium-term (90 days)
- Long-term (1 year)

NEXT REVIEW DATE: {YYYY-MM-DD}

REVIEW TRIGGERS:
What events would require immediate reassessment?
- Specific data releases (e.g., "CPI print >4%")
- Earnings from key companies (e.g., "NVDA earnings")
- Policy changes (e.g., "Fed rate decision")

FALSIFICATION CRITERIA:
What would prove this thesis WRONG?
| Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| | |
| | |

THESIS INVALID IF:
Write explicit statement of when to abandon thesis.
