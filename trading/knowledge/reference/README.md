## Templates Moved to Skills

Templates and scaffolding have been moved to the **skills** package for agent-agnostic use.

See: `skills/` for:
- `document-creation/` - Earnings, stock analysis, ticker, research templates
- `trade-management/` - Trade journal, watchlist templates
- `learning-loop/` - Post-trade review, learning templates
- `market-scanning/` - Scanner configurations

This separation keeps **knowledge** focused on actual knowledge (data, insights, history) while **skills** contains the workflows and instructions for any AI agent to follow.
