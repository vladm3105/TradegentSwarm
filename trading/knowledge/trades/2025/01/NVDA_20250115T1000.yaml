catalyst: earnings
thesis:
  summary: Pre-earnings positioning based on strong hyperscaler capex signals and technical support
  confidence: 0.72
  edge: Customer demand analysis showing all major hyperscalers raising AI capex
  invalidation:
  - Break below $128 support
  - Negative customer demand signals
  - Major export restriction news
execution:
  direction: long
  structure: shares
  entries:
  - date: '2025-01-15'
    action: buy
    qty: 50
    price: 136.2
    notes: Entry at support, per earnings-momentum strategy
  exits:
  - date: '2025-01-28'
    action: sell
    qty: 50
    price: 148.5
    reason: Took profit pre-earnings
    notes: Exited early due to profit protection instinct
results:
  gross_pnl: 615.0
  net_pnl: 613.0
  return_pct: 9.0
  holding_days: 13
  outcome: win
review:
  thesis_correct: true
  entry_timing: good
  exit_timing: early
  what_worked:
  - Entry timing at support was correct
  - Customer demand analysis was predictive
  - Position sizing appropriate for conviction level
  what_failed:
  - Exited before catalyst that justified entry
  - Left 6% additional gains on table
  biases_detected:
  - bias: loss_aversion
    impact: Exited at +9% when move was +15%
    cost_estimate: 300
  lessons:
  - Pre-earnings entry works, but need discipline to hold through catalyst
  - When thesis intact and catalyst pending, don't exit just to lock gains
  framework_updates:
  - 'Add pre-exit gate: Is thesis still intact? Is catalyst still pending?'
