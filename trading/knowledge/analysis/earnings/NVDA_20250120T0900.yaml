# PHASE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT AND BIAS CHECK
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

phase6_risk_and_bias:
  
  # Mandatory Bias Checks (per skill)
  bias_checks:
    recency:
      status: pass
      check: "Am I overweighting recent news?"
      analysis: "Recent 8% decline is technical, not fundamental. Customer demand signals from Jan are fresh and bullish. Not overweighting the price decline."
      
    confirmation:
      status: pass
      check: "Have I sought contradicting evidence?"
      analysis: "Actively sought bear case: valuation at 35x forward, China exposure ~20%, potential margin compression from Blackwell transition. These are real but manageable risks."
      
    timing_conservatism:
      status: pass
      check: "Am I waiting for 'confirmation' when conviction >70%?"
      analysis: "Conviction is 72%. Stock is declining. Per skill: this is ENTRY SIGNAL not warning. Planning to enter at $135-138 support zone NOW, not wait."
      
    anchoring:
      status: pass
      check: "Am I fixated on arbitrary price targets?"
      analysis: "Entry based on support levels ($135), not arbitrary round numbers. Stop based on technical invalidation ($128), not arbitrary %."
      
  # Steel-Man Exercise (per skill)
  steel_man:
    bear_case: |
      STRONGEST argument against bullish thesis:
      
      1. VALUATION: At 35x forward earnings, NVDA is priced for perfection. Any slight miss 
         or deceleration could trigger 20%+ correction. Multiples this high historically 
         contract when growth slows.
         
      2. CHINA RISK: ~20% of revenue exposed to export restrictions. Further tightening 
         could materially impact results. This is binary political risk.
         
      3. COMPETITION: AMD gaining share in inference. Google TPUs, Amazon Trainium, 
         Microsoft Maia all reducing reliance on NVDA. 2-3 year outlook less certain.
         
      4. BLACKWELL TRANSITION: Product transitions historically cause margin compression 
         and execution risk. Q4 could be messy.
         
    can_argue_both_sides: true
    bias_assessment: "Can articulate bear case with conviction. Not blindly bullish."
