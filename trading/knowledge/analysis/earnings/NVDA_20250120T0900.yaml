phase6_risk_and_bias:
  bias_checks:
    recency:
      status: pass
      check: Am I overweighting recent news?
      analysis: Recent 8% decline is technical, not fundamental. Customer demand signals from Jan are fresh and bullish. Not
        overweighting the price decline.
    confirmation:
      status: pass
      check: Have I sought contradicting evidence?
      analysis: 'Actively sought bear case: valuation at 35x forward, China exposure ~20%, potential margin compression from
        Blackwell transition. These are real but manageable risks.'
    timing_conservatism:
      status: pass
      check: Am I waiting for 'confirmation' when conviction >70%?
      analysis: 'Conviction is 72%. Stock is declining. Per skill: this is ENTRY SIGNAL not warning. Planning to enter at
        $135-138 support zone NOW, not wait.'
    anchoring:
      status: pass
      check: Am I fixated on arbitrary price targets?
      analysis: Entry based on support levels ($135), not arbitrary round numbers. Stop based on technical invalidation ($128),
        not arbitrary %.
  steel_man:
    bear_case: "STRONGEST argument against bullish thesis:\n\n1. VALUATION: At 35x forward earnings, NVDA is priced for perfection.\
      \ Any slight miss \n   or deceleration could trigger 20%+ correction. Multiples this high historically \n   contract\
      \ when growth slows.\n   \n2. CHINA RISK: ~20% of revenue exposed to export restrictions. Further tightening \n   could\
      \ materially impact results. This is binary political risk.\n   \n3. COMPETITION: AMD gaining share in inference. Google\
      \ TPUs, Amazon Trainium, \n   Microsoft Maia all reducing reliance on NVDA. 2-3 year outlook less certain.\n   \n4.\
      \ BLACKWELL TRANSITION: Product transitions historically cause margin compression \n   and execution risk. Q4 could\
      \ be messy.\n   \n"
    can_argue_both_sides: true
    bias_assessment: Can articulate bear case with conviction. Not blindly bullish.

    adjustment: Reduce size due to Do Nothing gate warnings
