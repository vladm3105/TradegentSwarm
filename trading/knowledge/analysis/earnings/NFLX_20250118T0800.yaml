phase6_risk_and_bias:
  bias_checks:
    recency:
      status: warning
      check: Am I overweighting recent news?
      analysis: NFL games and Squid Game success are fresh; may be overweighting. Content success doesn't always translate
        to subs.
    confirmation:
      status: pass
      check: Have I sought contradicting evidence?
      analysis: 'Bear case: Valuation at 45x, near ATH, password sharing gains may slow, price increases could hurt retention.'
    timing_conservatism:
      status: noted
      check: Am I waiting for 'confirmation' when conviction >70%?
      analysis: Stock near ATH. Not a clear timing conservatism situation - caution is warranted here.
    anchoring:
      status: pass
      check: Am I fixated on arbitrary price targets?
      analysis: Using $850 support (20-day MA) not arbitrary level. Stop at $800 based on 50-day MA.
  steel_man:
    bear_case: "STRONGEST argument against bullish thesis:\n\n1. VALUATION: Trading at 45x forward P/E near all-time highs.\
      \ Any disappointment \n   could trigger significant correction. Market expects perfection.\n   \n2. PASSWORD SHARING\
      \ TAILWIND ENDING: 2024 benefited from password crackdown. \n   This one-time boost won't repeat in 2025. Organic growth\
      \ will be harder.\n   \n3. CONTENT COSTS: Live sports (NFL, WWE) are expensive. Margins may not expand \n   as much\
      \ as bulls expect if content costs accelerate.\n   \n4. COMPETITION: Disney+ with ESPN integration, Amazon Prime with\
      \ NFL, Apple TV+ \n   all improving. Streaming wars not over.\n   \n"
    can_argue_both_sides: true
    bias_assessment: Can articulate bear case. Bullish but not blindly so.
