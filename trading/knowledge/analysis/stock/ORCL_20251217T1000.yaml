    name: Post-earnings collapse + Blue Owl financing withdrawal
    description: |
      ORCL has declined 45% from September high of $329.50 driven by:
      - Dec 10: Q2 FY2026 earnings miss on revenue despite EPS beat → -11% after-hours
      - Dec 11-16: Continued selling, breach of $200, $190, $185 support
      - Dec 17 (TODAY): Blue Owl Capital withdrew from $10B Michigan data center financing
  thesis:
    summary: Panic oversold on financing news creates contrarian opportunity
    detailed: |
      Oracle has massive RPO backlog ($523B, +438% YoY) indicating strong demand.
      Current selloff is driven by financing concerns, not fundamental weakness.
      If financing is secured from alternative sources, stock recovers significantly.
      Risk: Value trap if financing issues persist or fundamentals deteriorate.

  decision_rationale: |
    Setup quality 3/10 and EV 1.54% both fail minimum thresholds.
    Stock is in freefall with no base established.
    WAIT for:
    - Capitulation at $165-170 with volume spike
    - Base building pattern at higher level ($175-180)
    - Positive catalyst (financing announcement)

    Better risk-reward entry exists; patience required.
