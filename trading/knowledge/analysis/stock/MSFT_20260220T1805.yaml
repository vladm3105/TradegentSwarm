recommendation: "WATCH"

rationale: |
  MSFT is deeply oversold (-28% from October highs) with strong fundamentals
  (Azure 38% growth, $50B cloud run rate, 90% Fortune 500 Copilot adoption)
  and massive analyst upside targets ($594-631 vs $397 current). However, the
  trend is clearly down, stock is lagging peers significantly, and lacks an
  immediate catalyst. The $392-395 support zone is critical. A confirmed
  bounce with improved relative strength would upgrade to BUY.

# If WATCH, specify trigger
watchlist_trigger: "Break above $405 with volume confirmation OR successful retest of $392-395 support with bullish reversal candle"
