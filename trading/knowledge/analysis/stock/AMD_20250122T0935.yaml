    description: AMD has consolidated between $115-135 for 3 months. Now testing upper resistance with increasing volume.
  thesis:
    summary: AMD breakout above $135 resistance with AI datacenter tailwinds
    detailed: |
      AMD is positioned for a technical breakout driven by:
      1. 3-month consolidation creating clear resistance at $135
      2. Increasing volume on recent tests of resistance
      3. Sector tailwind from AI infrastructure spending cycle
      4. Relative underperformance vs NVDA creating catch-up potential
  timeframe:
    expected_duration: 2-4 weeks
    catalyst_date: Imminent (breakout setup)
  invalidation:
    thesis_wrong_if:
    - Fails to break $135 on 3rd test
    - Closes below $120 (breakdown)
    - NVDA sells off >10% (sector drag)
    - Volume dries up on breakout attempt

    name: Failed breakout
    probability: 0.2
    price_target: 118
    downside_pct: -11
    timeframe: 1-2 weeks
    triggers:
    - Rejection at $135 resistance
    - Breakdown below $125
    - Sector rotation out of semis

  expected_value:
    ev_pct: 7.45

    ev_assessment: Slightly below 8% threshold but close
phase7_risk_management:
  bias_checks:
    recency_bias:
      check: Am I extrapolating recent price action?
      status: pass
      analysis: Not chasing after move. Waiting for breakout confirmation, not assuming it.
    confirmation_bias:
      check: Have I sought contradicting evidence?
      status: pass
      analysis: 'Bear case documented: failed breakout, sector rotation, MI300 competition. Have considered.'
    anchoring_bias:
      check: Am I fixated on arbitrary price levels?
      status: pass
      analysis: Entry at $136 based on breakout confirmation, not arbitrary. Stop at $128 based on pattern invalidation.
    loss_aversion:
      check: Will I follow exit rules regardless of emotion?
      status: noted
      analysis: Pre-committing to stop at $128. Will not move stop down.
    overconfidence:
      check: Am I oversizing based on conviction?
      status: pass
      analysis: Position size 3% despite high conviction. Not oversizing.
  entry:
    trigger: Break and close above $135 on above-average volume
    entry_price: 136
    entry_type: Breakout confirmation
    volume_requirement: '>50M shares on breakout day'

    stop_distance_pct: 5.9
    position_size_pct: 3.0

    rationale: Setup quality 7/10, EV slightly below threshold, sizing conservatively
  stop_loss:
    price: 128
    type: Pattern invalidation
    rationale: Below breakout level and 50-day MA. If falls here, breakout failed.

  profit_targets:
    target_1:
      price: 145
      action: Sell 40%
      rationale: Next resistance level
    target_2:

      action: Sell 40%
      rationale: Measured move target
