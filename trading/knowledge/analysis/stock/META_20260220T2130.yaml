rationale: |
  META presents a compelling post-earnings entry opportunity. Q4 2025 beat expectations with 24% revenue growth and record margins (41%), while the -11% pullback from $738 provides a better risk/reward entry than chasing the post-earnings gap. Strong analyst consensus (92% buy, median PT $838) supports upside, though elevated VIX (20.82) and massive AI capex ($115-135B) introduce execution risk. The 10-day/50-day golden cross and support at $628 provide technical confirmation. EV of +5% with 2:1 R/R makes this actionable at current levels.
