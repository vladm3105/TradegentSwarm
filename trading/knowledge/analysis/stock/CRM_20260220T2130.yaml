# Scoring & Recommendation
scoring:
  catalyst_score: 1.75  # 7 * 0.25
  environment_score: 0.75  # 5 * 0.15
  technical_score: 1.00  # 4 * 0.25
  risk_reward_score: 1.75  # 7 * 0.25
  sentiment_score: 0.70  # 7 * 0.10

  weighted_total: 5.95  # Out of 10

recommendation: "WATCH"

rationale: |
  CRM has compelling fundamentals with Agentforce AI momentum (330% ARR growth),
  strong cash flow, and significant upside to analyst targets ($319 avg vs $188 current).
  However, poor technicals (trading below all major moving averages, distribution pattern,
  24 bearish indicators) and sector rotation headwinds (XLK -3% YTD) create unfavorable
  entry timing. Score of 5.95/10 falls in WATCH zone. Wait for technical confirmation
  before initiating position.

watchlist_trigger: "Break and close above $200 with above-average volume, OR successful test of $170-175 support with reversal candle pattern"
