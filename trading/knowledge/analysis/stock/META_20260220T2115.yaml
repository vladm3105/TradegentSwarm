recommendation: "WATCH"

rationale: |
  META exhibits strong fundamental positioning with AI pivot catalyst, attractive valuation (27x PE vs 41x fair value),
  and robust analyst support (96% buy ratings, $844 avg target). However, near-term technical weakness (trading below
  MAs, underperforming sector) and suboptimal risk/reward ratio (~1:1 to base case target) suggest waiting for better
  entry. Monitor for bounce off 610-630 support or POC breakout above 662 before initiating position.

# If WATCH, specify trigger
watchlist_trigger: "Entry: Price holds 610-630 support with volume confirmation OR breaks above 662 POC. Invalidation: Close below 579 consolidation zone."
