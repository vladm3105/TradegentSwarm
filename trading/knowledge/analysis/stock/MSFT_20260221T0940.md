## Phase 1: Catalyst & Thesis Identification

### Recent Catalyst: Q2 FY2026 Earnings (Jan 28) — BEAT but SOLD OFF

**What Happened:**
- Revenue: $81.3B (+17% YoY) — **BEAT** ($80.3B expected)
- EPS: $4.14 adjusted (+24% YoY) — **BEAT** ($3.91 expected)
- GAAP EPS: $5.16 (+60% YoY) — massive beat including OpenAI gains
- Microsoft Cloud: $51.5B (+26% YoY) — first time above $50B
- Azure: +39% YoY (+38% cc) — **SLIGHT MISS** vs 39.4% StreetAccount consensus
- CapEx: $37.5B — **66% surge YoY** — spooked investors
- Commercial bookings: +230% — driven by large Azure/OpenAI commitments

**Why the Stock Cratered -10% (Jan 29):**
1. Azure growth deceleration (39% vs 40% prior quarter, guided 37-38% for Q3)
2. Massive $37.5B quarterly CapEx (~$150B annual run rate) with unclear ROI timeline
3. Cloud gross margin guided to ~65%, down YoY
4. "Sell the news" reaction after stock was at ~$480 pre-earnings
5. Broader "SaaS-apocalypse" fears — software sector-wide selloff

**Subsequent Decline:**
- Feb 5: Additional -5% on Stifel downgrade (Buy → Hold, PT $540 → $392)
- Continued software sector weakness through mid-February
- Total decline from pre-earnings ~$480 to ~$397 = **-17.3% in 3 weeks**

### Active Catalysts (Forward-Looking)

1. **Azure Re-Acceleration Watch** — Q3 guided 37-38% cc. If capacity constraints ease and growth rebounds >38%, significant catalyst
2. **Copilot Monetization** — M365 Copilot hit 15M paid seats (+160% YoY). Enterprise adoption curve is early
3. **Agentic AI** — Next frontier beyond chatbots; Microsoft well-positioned with enterprise relationships
4. **CapEx Inflection** — Sequential decrease guided for Q3. Market wants to see spending discipline
5. **Phil Spencer Departure** — Gaming head retiring after 38 years (announced Feb 21). Symbolic but minor fundamental impact
6. **OpenAI Developments** — Targeting ~$600B compute spend by 2030; MSFT is primary beneficiary
7. **Valuation Reset** — At 22.6x forward P/E, MSFT is cheapest among Mag 7 relative to growth rate

### Trade Thesis

Microsoft has been punished disproportionately for a fractional Azure deceleration (39% vs 40%) while delivering exceptional headline results. The -28.5% decline from ATH has created the most attractive entry point since mid-2024. With AI demand exceeding supply (Amy Hood confirmed capacity constraints), the deceleration is supply-driven not demand-driven. As GPU capacity comes online in H2 FY2026, Azure growth should re-accelerate, catalyzing multiple expansion back toward fair value.

**Thesis Statement:** MSFT represents a high-conviction mean-reversion opportunity where the market has overreacted to marginal Azure deceleration and CapEx concerns, creating a compelling entry point for a stock with structural AI tailwinds and industry-leading cloud position.

**Timeframe:** Through Q3 FY2026 earnings (~10 weeks) + potential hold through H2 FY2026  
**Invalidation Criteria:**
- Azure growth decelerates below 35% in Q3 (demand problem, not supply)
- Copilot adoption stalls or churn increases
- CapEx continues rising while revenue growth slows (margin compression spiral)
- Close below $370 support (next major level below current)
- Broader macro/recession forces sustained multiple compression

---

## Phase 2: Market Environment Assessment

### Broader Market Context
- **S&P 500:** ~6,910 — near highs but rotation occurring away from software
- **VIX:** 19.09 — elevated but declining, post-tariff/geopolitical concerns
- **Fed Policy:** Rate environment still a factor; market pricing in selective cuts
- **Macro Risks:** Private credit worries, potential Iran strike, tariff uncertainty
- **Dollar Index:** 97.73 — weakening, which is TAILWIND for MSFT (FX boost to revenue)

### Cloud/Software Sector Analysis

| Company | Cloud Growth | AI Strategy | Stock YTD |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| MSFT (Azure) | 39% YoY | Full-stack leader | -17% from Jan |
| AMZN (AWS) | ~19% YoY | Strong infra | Outperforming |
| GOOGL (GCP) | ~35% YoY | DeepMind integration | Outperforming |
| META | N/A | Massive AI spend, stock +8% on earnings | Outperforming |

**Key Insight:** MSFT is uniquely punished among hyperscalers. META reported massive AI CapEx on the SAME DAY and rallied 8%. The market is selectively penalizing MSFT's AI spend while rewarding others. This disconnect suggests irrational sentiment rather than fundamental deterioration.

### Software Sector Headwinds
- Broad "SaaS-apocalypse" narrative — AI replacing traditional software revenue
- DeepSeek-driven concerns about open-source AI disrupting premium pricing
- Stifel's Brad Reback downgrade citing FY2027 estimates too high
- Multiple compression across the sector

### Correlation Dynamics
- MSFT trading with 0.95 beta — slightly less volatile than market
- Currently underperforming both S&P 500 and Nasdaq significantly
- Relative weakness creates contrarian opportunity IF fundamentals intact

**Environment Assessment:** CHALLENGING SHORT-TERM but OPPORTUNITY for patient capital. Sector rotation creating dislocation from fundamentals.

---

## Phase 3: Technical Analysis & Setup Quality

### Multi-Timeframe Review

**Weekly Chart:**
- Testing 39-month trendline from November 2022 lows
- RSI near 18-29 range — deeply oversold (rare for MSFT)
- Death cross: 50-day MA ($446-469) well below 200-day MA ($486-490)
- Volume increasing on down moves — capitulation characteristics

**Daily Chart:**
- Declining since Oct 28, 2025 ATH ($555.45)
- Accelerated selloff post-Jan 28 earnings
- Recent support test at $392-395 range (Feb 5 pivot bottom)
- Slight bounce to $397 — testing support zone
- MACD showing potential bottoming but not confirmed

**Key Technical Levels:**

| Level | Type | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| $555.45 | ATH | July 2025 peak — distant target |
| $486-490 | 200-day MA | Major overhead resistance |
| $446-469 | 50-day MA | Intermediate resistance |
| $430 | Accumulated volume resistance | First significant overhead |
| $400-406 | Psychological / liquidity gap | Near-term resistance |
| **$392-397** | **Current zone / Support** | **Accumulated volume support; pivot bottom Feb 5** |
| $370 | Next support | Previous consolidation |
| $344.79 | 52-week low | April 2025 low — critical floor |

**Technical Indicators:**
- RSI (14): ~29 — **OVERSOLD** (buy signal territory)
- MACD: -18.78 — bearish but showing divergence potential
- CCI (14): -147 — **OVERSOLD** (buy signal)
- ADX: ~34 — strong downtrend (caution: trend could continue)
- All major MAs: below 10, 20, 50, 100, 200-day — **STRONG SELL on momentum**
- Bollinger Bands: widened significantly — elevated volatility

### Setup Quality Score: 7.5/10

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Deeply oversold on multiple indicators (RSI, CCI)
- ✅ Testing multi-year trendline support
- ✅ Fundamental strength (beat on revenue AND EPS)
- ✅ Valuation reset to rare discount (22.6x fwd P/E)
- ✅ Supply-driven deceleration (not demand problem)
- ✅ Contrarian opportunity — extreme negative sentiment
- ⚠️ Death cross active — momentum traders still selling
- ⚠️ ADX shows strong downtrend (could continue lower)
- ❌ No confirmed reversal pattern yet

**BIAS CHECK:** Am I falling into "anchoring bias" using the $555 ATH as mental target? The realistic recovery target should be based on fundamentals and re-rating catalysts, not historical price. Am I catching a falling knife because of confirmation bias from bullish fundamentals? The earnings framework says: **Technical weakness + strong fundamentals (>70% conviction) = ENTRY SIGNAL, not warning.**

---

## Phase 4: Fundamental Analysis

### Q2 FY2026 Results (Most Recent — Jan 28, 2026)

| Metric | Actual | YoY Growth | Vs. Estimates |
|--------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Revenue | $81.3B | +17% | Beat ($80.3B) |
| Non-GAAP EPS | $4.14 | +24% | Beat ($3.91) |
| GAAP EPS | $5.16 | +60% | Beat (incl. OpenAI gains) |
| Operating Income | $38.3B | +21% | Beat |
| Operating Margin | 47.1% | Expansion | Strong |
| Microsoft Cloud | $51.5B | +26% | Record |
| Azure Growth | 39% (38% cc) | Slight decel | Missed 39.4% |
| CapEx | $37.5B | +66% | Spooked market |
| Cash Flow from Ops | $35.8B | +60% | Excellent |
| M365 Copilot Seats | 15M | +160% | Strong adoption |
| Commercial Bookings | +230% | | OpenAI contracts |

### Q3 FY2026 Guidance

| Metric | Guidance | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Revenue | $80.65-81.75B | +15-17% YoY, meets consensus |
| Azure Growth | 37-38% cc | Deceleration from 38% cc |
| CapEx | Decrease sequentially | Positive signal |
| Cloud Gross Margin | ~65% | Down YoY (AI investments) |
| Operating Margins | Down slightly YoY | FY2026 full-year: up slightly |
| P&BP Revenue | $34.25-34.55B | +14-15% |

### Key Metric Deep Dive: Azure Growth + AI Contribution

**The Critical Nuance the Market is Missing:**

Per CFO Amy Hood's commentary, AI services now contribute **22-26 percentage points** of Azure's total 39% growth. This means:
- AI contribution: ~22-26% (growing rapidly)
- Base Azure growth: ~13-17% (traditional cloud, slowing but stable)
- **Total is supply-constrained, NOT demand-limited**

Hood explicitly stated: **"If I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2 and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40."**

This is the single most important data point. Azure growth is HELD BACK by capacity constraints, not demand erosion. As more GPU clusters come online, growth should re-accelerate.

### Customer Demand Analysis (50% Weight per Framework)

**Hyperscaler/Enterprise AI Demand Signals:**
- OpenAI: Targeting ~$600B total compute spend by 2030 (confirmed Feb 21)
- NVIDIA: Reported massive data center revenue — AI demand robust
- Meta: Raising AI CapEx significantly (stock rewarded)
- Amazon: Planning big step-up in 2026 CapEx
- Enterprise Copilot adoption: 70% of Fortune 500 using M365 Copilot

**Assessment:** Customer demand is ACCELERATING, not decelerating. All major AI customers increasing spend. This is VERY BULLISH per the data source hierarchy framework.

### Management Guidance Track Record
- Microsoft has consistently guided conservatively
- Q2 beat on top and bottom line
- FY2026 operating margins guided "up slightly" — positive signal

### Valuation Context

| Metric | Current | 5-Year Avg | Assessment |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| Fwd P/E | 22.6x | ~30-35x | **Significant discount** |
| P/E TTM | 24.85x | ~32x | Below average |
| EV/Revenue | ~9.7x | ~12x | Compressed |
| Revenue Growth | 17% | | Accelerating from prior years |
| FCF Yield | ~3.5% | | Attractive for mega-cap |

**MSFT is trading at the cheapest forward P/E among Mag 7 stocks relative to its growth rate.** This represents a valuation dislocation, not a fundamental deterioration.

**NEWS AGE CHECK:**
- Q2 earnings selloff: 24 days old → Reaction priced in, but recovery not started
- Stifel downgrade: 16 days old → Likely fully priced in
- Phil Spencer departure: 0 days → Fresh news, minor impact
- OpenAI compute target: 0 days → Fresh, positive for long-term thesis
- Software sector selloff: Ongoing → Not fully resolved

---

## Phase 5: Sentiment & Positioning Analysis

### Analyst Consensus
- **Rating:** Strong Buy (33 analysts)
- **Average Price Target:** ~$594-603 (49-52% upside from current)
- **Range:** $392 (Stifel low) to $675-678 (Truist high)
- **Median 12-month target:** ~$596-629 (47-58% upside)

### Key Analyst Actions Post-Earnings
| Analyst | Action | Price Target |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Stifel (Reback) | **Downgrade to Hold** | $540 → $392 |
| Citigroup | Maintained Buy | Adjusted lower |
| DA Davidson | Maintained | ~$500+ |
| Philip Securities | **Upgrade to Buy** | Entry opportunity |
| Wedbush (Ives) | Maintained Outperform | $625 → $575 |
| J.P. Morgan | Called selloff "broken logic" | Bullish |
| Seeking Alpha | Strong Buy, PT $562 | Accumulation opportunity |

**Assessment:** Overwhelming consensus remains bullish. Only 1 of 33+ analysts downgraded. The market is trading at the bearish outlier's price target ($392), meaning ALL upside revisions are being ignored.

### Institutional Positioning
- Institutional ownership: 73.14%
- Top holders: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street — combined 1.57B shares
- No major institutional selling flagged (rotation, not flight)
- Returned $12.7B to shareholders in Q2 (+32% YoY) — buyback support

### Retail Sentiment
- Fear/capitulation evident in social media
- "Worst day in 5 years" headlines driving panic
- Multiple "buy the dip" articles appearing — contrarian indicator forming
- TradingView signals showing RSI collapse at rare levels (near 18)

### Short Interest
- Low short interest — not a squeeze setup
- But also means limited forced selling ahead

### Sentiment Score: EXTREME FEAR / DEEPLY BEARISH

**Crowded Trade Assessment:**
- Consensus was crowded LONG at $480-555 → those positions are being unwound
- Current sentiment is approaching capitulation
- **Contrarian signal: When everyone is bearish on a fundamentally strong company, history favors the bulls**

---

## Phase 6: Probability-Weighted Assessment

### Scenario Framework

**Scenario 1: Mean Reversion Rally (45% probability)**
- Catalyst: Oversold bounce + sector rotation back into quality
- Azure narrative improves as capacity comes online
- Stock recovers toward 200-day MA zone
- **Expected Move:** +15-25%
- **Target:** $455-500 (8-14 weeks)
- **Confidence drivers:** Extreme RSI, valuation discount, intact demand

**Scenario 2: Gradual Recovery / Range-Bound (30% probability)**
- Stock stabilizes in $390-430 range
- Market waits for Q3 earnings confirmation
- Slow grind higher without strong catalyst
- **Expected Move:** +3-10%
- **Target:** $410-435 (8-14 weeks)

**Scenario 3: Continued Decline / Macro Shock (25% probability)**
- Broader market correction (tariffs, recession fears, Iran)
- Software sector continues to de-rate
- Azure deceleration worse than expected
- **Expected Move:** -8% to -15%
- **Target:** $340-370

### Expected Value Calculation

```
EV = (0.45 × +20%) + (0.30 × +6%) + (0.25 × -12%)
EV = 9.0% + 1.8% - 3.0%
EV = +7.8%
```

**Expected Value: +7.8%**

### Implied Move Analysis (Options Market)

**Current Options Landscape:**
- 30-Day IV (Puts): ~28.2% — elevated (recent selloff)
- IV Percentile: ~89% (HIGH — near 1-year highs)
- Historical volatility rising due to selloff
- Next earnings April 28 — IV will increase as it approaches

**Assessment:** High IV means options are EXPENSIVE. Per the framework:
- High conviction + High IV = **Bull call spreads** (sell expensive premium)
- NOT long calls (too much IV premium to overcome)

**EV (+7.8%) EXCEEDS the "Do Nothing" gate threshold of 5%.** ✅

---

## Phase 7: Risk Assessment & Bias Check

### Mandatory Bias Checks

| Bias | Check | Assessment |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Recency Bias** | ☑️ | Not overweighting the selloff panic; looking at multi-quarter fundamentals |
| **Confirmation Bias** | ⚠️ | Actively seeking bear case — Stifel's FY2027 concerns are valid; CapEx ROI is genuinely uncertain |
| **Timing Conservatism** | ☑️ | Framework explicitly says: weakness + strong fundamentals + high conviction = ENTRY SIGNAL. This is the pattern. Don't wait for "confirmation." |
| **Anchoring** | ⚠️ | Not anchoring to $555 ATH. Using $455-500 as realistic 8-14 week target based on MA convergence |
| **Overconfidence** | ☑️ | Position sizing capped; staged entry planned; stop-loss defined |
| **Loss Aversion** | ☑️ | Pre-defining exit criteria eliminates emotional decision-making |

### Steel-Man Bear Case

**Why MSFT Could Continue to Decline:**

1. **AI CapEx Black Hole:** $37.5B/quarter ($150B/year) with unclear payback period. Even if demand is strong, margin compression could persist for years. The market learned from the 2000s fiber-optic buildout — massive spending doesn't always translate to returns.

2. **Azure Base Growth Erosion:** Strip out AI contribution (22-26 pts), and base Azure is growing only 13-17%. If AI contribution stalls or commoditizes (DeepSeek open-source models), the 39% headline number collapses.

3. **Copilot Monetization Risk:** 15M seats sounds impressive but that's a fraction of the 400M+ M365 base. If enterprise ROI from Copilot isn't proven, adoption could plateau. At ~$30/seat/month, this is ~$5.4B annual revenue — meaningful but not transformative yet.

4. **FY2027 Estimate Risk:** Stifel's core argument — consensus FY2027 estimates are too high. If revenue growth slows to 12-14% and margins compress, the stock could de-rate further even at current levels.

5. **Competitive Pressure:** AWS and GCP gaining in AI. Google's Gemini models improving rapidly. Open-source AI (DeepSeek, Llama) could erode premium pricing power.

6. **Macro/Tariff Risk:** Rising memory prices could increase CapEx costs further. Tariffs on semiconductor imports. Recession reducing enterprise IT budgets.

**Counterargument Strength:** 7/10 — Bear case has legitimate concerns, particularly around CapEx ROI timing and base Azure deceleration. However, the demand signals from customers (hyperscaler capex increases across the board) strongly suggest this is supply-constrained, not demand-impaired.

### Key Counter-Arguments to Bear Case:
- Amy Hood explicitly stated Azure would have been >40% growth without capacity constraints
- Commercial bookings +230% — massive forward revenue visibility
- RPO (remaining performance obligations) growing — contracted future revenue
- Copilot is in early innings; enterprise AI adoption historically follows S-curve
- $108B cash reserve provides massive cushion and buyback support
- FX tailwind emerging as dollar weakens

## Phase 8: Final Decision Framework

### "Do Nothing" Gate Check

| Criteria | Threshold | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Expected Value | >5% | +7.8% | ✅ PASS |
| Confidence | >60% | 72% | ✅ PASS |
| Risk:Reward | >2:1 | ~3:1 ($27 risk to $370 stop / $80 upside to $475) | ✅ PASS |
| Edge Not Priced | Yes | Oversold on sentiment, not fundamentals | ✅ PASS |

**Gate Result: PASS (4 of 4 criteria)** ✅

### Position Determination

| Confidence Level | Recommended Action |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| >70% | Full directional position |
| 55-70% | Reduced size or spreads |
| <55% | No position or volatility play |

**Current Confidence: 72%** → Full directional position appropriate

### Pre-Earnings Entry Strategy (Per Timing Conservatism Framework)

The earnings-analysis skill explicitly warns: **"Your Primary Bias: Timing Conservatism. You get DIRECTION right but TIMING wrong."**

Current situation maps perfectly:
- **Conviction: >70%** ✅
- **Price declining significantly (-28% from ATH)** ✅
- **Fundamentals strong (beat earnings, demand > supply)** ✅
- **This is the ENTRY SIGNAL the framework was designed to catch**

### Recommendation: **BULLISH — STAGED ENTRY** (72% confidence)

---

## Trade Plan

### Entry Strategy (Staged)

**Tranche 1 — Immediate (50% of intended position):**
- **Entry Zone:** $395-400 (current levels)
- **Rationale:** RSI at extreme oversold, sitting on accumulated volume support, 22.6x forward P/E
- **Action:** Enter 50% position NOW while at support

**Tranche 2 — On Further Weakness (30% of intended position):**
- **Entry Zone:** $370-385
- **Rationale:** If broader market weakness pushes MSFT lower, add at next support level
- **Action:** Limit order at $378

**Tranche 3 — On Breakout Confirmation (20% of intended position):**
- **Entry Zone:** Above $410 with volume
- **Rationale:** Confirms reversal pattern; adds on strength
- **Action:** Buy on close above $410

### Position Structure

**Given: High Conviction (72%) + High IV (~89th percentile) → Bull Call Spreads**

**Recommended Structure:**
- **Primary:** Bull Call Spread — Buy $400 Call / Sell $450 Call, May 2026 expiration
  - Captures recovery toward 50-day MA zone
  - Sells expensive premium against position
  - Max reward/risk ratio ~3:1 at current prices
  - Expiration spans Q3 earnings (April 28) for catalyst
- **Alternative:** Cash-secured Put at $370 strike (April expiration)
  - Collects premium while waiting for lower entry
  - If assigned, excellent entry point below current support

**Position Size:**
- 4-5% max portfolio allocation across all tranches
- Tranche 1: 2-2.5% (immediate)
- Tranche 2: 1.5% (on weakness)
- Tranche 3: 1% (on confirmation)

### Risk Management

| Parameter | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Stop Loss | $370 (close below) | -6.8% from entry; below next support |
| Hard Stop | $344 (52-week low) | -13.3% — thesis completely invalidated |
| Profit Target 1 | $435 (+9.5%) | Partial take-profit at accumulated volume resistance |
| Profit Target 2 | $465-475 (+17-20%) | Near 50-day MA zone; significant profit-taking |
| Profit Target 3 | $500+ (+26%) | Hold if Q3 earnings catalyst confirms re-acceleration |
| Time Stop | If no meaningful recovery by mid-April, reassess before Q3 earnings |

### Falsification Criteria
**Thesis is WRONG if:**
- Q3 Azure growth comes in <35% (demand problem confirmed)
- Copilot seat growth decelerates materially
- CapEx guidance increases again instead of moderating
- Microsoft Cloud gross margin drops below 62% (profitability erosion)
- Management tone shifts cautious on AI demand
- Close below $370 on elevated volume
- Broader S&P 500 enters correction territory (-10%+ from highs)

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:
- Mean Reversion Rally: 45% → +20% move ($475-500)
- Gradual Recovery: 30% → +6% move ($420-435)
- Continued Decline: 25% → -12% move ($350-370)
Expected Value: +7.8%

RECOMMENDATION: BULLISH — STAGED ENTRY (72% confidence)

"DO NOTHING" GATE: ✅ PASSED (4/4 criteria met)

POSITION:
- Tranche 1: $395-400 (NOW) — 2.5% portfolio
- Tranche 2: $370-385 (limit order) — 1.5% portfolio
- Tranche 3: Above $410 (confirmation) — 1% portfolio
- Total: Up to 5% max allocation
- Structure: Bull call spreads ($400/$450 May 2026)
- Stop Loss: Close below $370 (-6.8%)
- Target 1: $435 (+9.5%) — partial profit
- Target 2: $465-475 (+17-20%) — major profit zone
- Target 3: $500+ — hold for Q3 catalyst

FALSIFICATION:
- Azure <35% Q3 (demand problem)
- Copilot adoption stalls
- CapEx increases further
- Close below $370 on volume
- Management tone shifts cautious

BIASES CHECKED:
- [x] Recency bias — not overweighting selloff panic
- [x] Confirmation bias — steel-manned bear case (7/10 strength)
- [x] Timing conservatism — THIS IS THE ENTRY SIGNAL (weakness + fundamentals)
- [x] Anchoring — targets based on MAs/fundamentals, not ATH
- [x] Both sides argued with equal rigor

KEY INSIGHT: Per framework's primary lesson — "Technical weakness +
strong fundamentals + high conviction = ENTRY SIGNAL, not warning."
MSFT maps perfectly to this pattern. The market is pricing a demand
problem, but the data shows a SUPPLY constraint. This is the
framework working as designed.

## Framework Notes

### Why This Is a Position vs. NFLX "No Position"

Comparing to the NFLX analysis (Jan 12, 2026):
- NFLX: EV +2.5% < 5% threshold → NO POSITION ❌
- MSFT: EV +7.8% > 5% threshold → POSITION ✅
- NFLX: Near ATH, priced for perfection → limited upside
- MSFT: -28.5% from ATH, priced for worst case → significant upside
- NFLX: Confidence 60% → below full position threshold
- MSFT: Confidence 72% → full position threshold met

**The framework is working as designed — passing on marginal setups (NFLX) and deploying capital on high-EV opportunities (MSFT).**

### Timing Conservatism Application

This is precisely the scenario the framework was built to address. Historical pattern: getting direction RIGHT but timing WRONG by waiting for "confirmation." The framework mandates action when conviction >70% AND price is declining AND fundamentals are intact. All three conditions are met.

### Learning Opportunity

This analysis will serve as a test case for the timing conservatism fix. Track whether immediate entry outperforms waiting for a "confirmed bottom." This is the data point that improves the framework.
