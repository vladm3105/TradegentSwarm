my_edge:
  what_works:
  - Customer demand analysis (hyperscaler capex) highly predictive
  - Pre-earnings entry on weakness with high conviction
  - Bull call spreads when IV elevated
  best_strategies:
  - earnings-momentum
  - covered-calls
  historical_performance:
    total_trades: 15
    wins: 12
    win_rate_pct: 80.0
    total_pnl: 8450.0
  watch_out_for:
  - risk: China export restrictions
    likelihood: medium
    mitigation: Monitor policy news; reduce size pre-announcement
  - risk: Valuation compression in risk-off
    likelihood: low-medium
    mitigation: Smaller positions when VIX elevated
  - risk: Competition from custom ASICs
    likelihood: low
    mitigation: Track hyperscaler in-house chip announcements
upcoming_catalysts:
- date: '2025-02-26'
  event: Q4 FY25 Earnings
  expected_impact: High - key metric is DC revenue
- date: '2025-03-18'
  event: GTC Conference
  expected_impact: Medium - Blackwell updates
- date: '2025-05-28'
  event: Q1 FY26 Earnings
  expected_impact: High
notes:
- date: '2025-01-20'
  note: All hyperscalers raising 2025 capex - very bullish for DC revenue
- date: '2024-11-15'
  note: Timing conservatism cost ~$500 on Q3 trade; entered late
