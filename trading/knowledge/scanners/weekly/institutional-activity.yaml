  interpretation_framework: |
    STRONGEST SIGNALS:
    - CEO buying after price drop = very bullish
    - Multiple top funds initiating position = bullish
    - Activist 13D filing = potential catalyst
    - Cluster insider buying = bullish
    
    WEAKER SIGNALS:
    - Single fund position change = needs context
    - Option exercise + sell = often neutral
    - Small insider buys = may be noise
    
    BEARISH SIGNALS:
    - Top funds exiting completely
    - Insider selling into strength
    - Declining institutional ownership
    
  timing_considerations: |
    - 13F data is 45 days old - prices may have moved
    - Insider buys are more timely (filed within 2 days)
    - Dark pool data is same day
    - Consider entry only if fundamentals still support
    
  common_mistakes_to_avoid:
    - "Blindly following 13F (data is old)"
    - "Ignoring context of insider sales"
    - "Not checking if stock has already moved"
    - "Following small/unknown funds"
    - "Treating all insider buys equally"
