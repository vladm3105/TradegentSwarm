  confidence: high
  validated: false

category: bias
subcategory: loss-aversion

pattern:
  description: "Exiting profitable pre-earnings positions early to 'lock in gains' before the catalyst that justified the entry"
  behavior: "When position reaches +5-10% profit before earnings, I feel urge to sell and 'protect' gains, even though thesis remains intact"
  trigger_conditions:
    - "Position profitable > 5%"
    - "Earnings catalyst still pending"
    - "General market volatility elevates anxiety"
    - "Time has passed since entry (feels like 'earned' gains)"
  frequency: systematic

    - trades/2024/META-052.yaml
    - trades/2025/NVDA-001.yaml
  occurrences: 3
  estimated_cost: 2400
  observations:
    - "AMZN: Exited +7%, actual move was +12% (missed 5%)"
    - "META: Exited +5%, actual move was +18% (missed 13%)"
    - "NVDA: Exited +9%, actual move was +15% (missed 6%)"

root_cause:
  psychological_driver: "Loss aversion manifesting as treating unrealized gains as 'house money' that must be protected"
  flawed_logic: "The earnings event IS the thesis - exiting before it defeats the purpose of the trade"
  contributing_factors:
    - "Uncertainty about earnings outcome despite high conviction"
    - "Desire to feel 'smart' by taking profit"
    - "Fear of giving back gains overrides expected value calculation"

countermeasure:
  rule: "When profitable AND thesis intact AND catalyst pending AND confidence > 70% → Hold minimum 50% through catalyst"
  implementation:
    - "Add pre-exit gate to trade workflow"
    - "Require answering: Is thesis intact? Is catalyst pending? Am I exiting due to LOGIC or FEAR?"
    - "If no new negative information, default to holding through catalyst"
  checklist_addition: "Pre-exit gate: Thesis intact + catalyst pending = DO NOT EXIT for profit protection"
  mantra: "The catalyst justified entry; don't exit before it arrives"

validation:
  status: pending
  criteria:
    - "Applied rule on next 5 pre-earnings trades"
    - "Tracked whether holding improved returns"
    - "Measured if rule prevented premature exits"
